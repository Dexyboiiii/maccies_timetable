# Maccies Timetable

Look we all know the employee clock view is the most jank thing ever to exist
imma make mine and your lives easier - this thing eats employee clock views for breakfast...
...and shits out .ics files ready for your calendar - never miss a shift again!

## Look I'm new to this still

You'll need Dart to run this, and obviously a login.
As of now it will only run through an html file from peoplestuffuk.com, so log in and download the schedule yourself,
place it in this project and change the open location in maccies_timetable.dart

## Hopes and aspirations

I'll call this project finished when it can be ran by a normal person, i.e.

- It has a method to log in, either via webviews/iframes or logging in by itself
- It can add the ics file to your calendar
- It won't break if someone has an overnight shift
