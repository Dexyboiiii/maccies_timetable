# Maccies Timetable

Look we all know the employee clock view is the most jank thing ever to exist
imma make mine and your lives easier - this thing eats employee clock views for breakfast...
...and shits out .ics files ready for your calendar - never miss a shift again!

## Look I'm new to this still

Download the webpage of your timetable as html, and run with the path to your file as the argument.

## Hopes and aspirations

I'll call this project finished when it can be ran by a normal person, i.e.

- It has a method to log in, either via webviews/iframes or logging in by itself
- It can add the ics file to your calendar
- It won't break if someone has an overnight shift
